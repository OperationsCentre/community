            <p>The land of Amarna needs farmers, crafters, mercenaries, and more!
                Our server offers an immersive RP experience crafted with precision by our
                admins who have taken a lot of time to help shape this server to be as fun and
                balanced as possible. With the help of many modifications, our server is packed
                full of new features, systems and tons of new items which have found their way
                into our economic system via vendors, but we wish to have players run their own
                stores and businesses. We have a strict set of rules which prevent things such
                as RDM, force RP and random raiding, our active and friendly staff members are
                there to ensure everyone has a fun and enjoyable time while still enforcing
                these rules.
